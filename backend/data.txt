About the Lead College of Management studies or The LEAD Story - A state -of -the -art, standalone MBA institute, approved by AICTE and affiliated to University of Calicut was established in 2011. The inception of LEAD College of Management traces back to 2010, when we applied for an MBA programme with an initial capacity of 60 seats, later extended to 120 seats in 2011. Despite initial setbacks in securing affiliation, we ultimately received approval for 120 seats later that year. Encouraged by reports from the University of Calicut indicating the imminent approval of an MBA college in Palakkad, we proceeded to recruit faculty, enroll 120 students, and commence classes. By the end of November 2010, it became evident that these students would be unable to sit for their first semester MBA examinations at LEAD College of Management. Out of the 120 enrolled students, 58 chose to remain with LEAD College of Management despite the external regulatory challenges. Consequently, alternative colleges were identified for the remaining students, who were duly transferred. In a demonstration of profound generosity, LEAD College of Management provided the 58 steadfast students with free boarding, lodging, and food, without charging them any fees for their academic pursuits. This act exemplified the magnanimity and responsive crisis management of LEAD College’s administration. That year, all 58 students graduated with exemplary marks, achieving a 100% pass rate. This pivotal moment marked the beginning of LEAD College of Management’s journey of growth starting in 2011. From the initial cohort of 58 students in 2012, LEAD College of Management now boasts an annual intake approval for 360 students, with an additional quota for economically weaker sections (EWS). The campus currently accommodates 700+ students, supported by 60 faculty and staff member. LEAD College of Management is celebrating the decennial anniversary of its inaugural graduating class this year. Now an autonomous institution affiliated to the University of Calicut, it is AICTE-approved, NAAC and NBA accredited, and undergoing a second cycle of NAAC accreditation in 2023-24. The college is ISO 21001:2018 certified and GSAAA accredited, and it has completed green, energy, and environmental audit certifications. LEAD College is a poised to launch its second professional post-graduate program Masters in Computer Applications. From 58 students in 2012, we have now grown to an approved annual intake of 360 in 2024, along with an additional quota for EWS and foreign students. Currently, the campus houses over 600 students and 50 faculty and staff members.

LEAD College of Management, Dhoni Palakkad is a brain child of Dr. Thomas George, a professional life-skill trainer for various Engineering & MBA students in and around Kerala for years. Dr Thomas’ training of students at various levels in a culture obsessed with measuring talent and ability opened his sense of creating an institution that gives importance to inspiration that might lead to entrepreneurship, social commitment and values. According to him, inspiration awakens to new possibilities by allowing one to transcend his ordinary experiences and limitations. Inspiration propels a person from apathy to possibility, and transforms the way one perceives his own capabilities. The idea of starting a business school in a three tier city of Kerala got conceived, germinated, nourished and became a reality in 2011.
